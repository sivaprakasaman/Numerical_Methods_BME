\frametitle{Question 3g $|$ Rank/Statistical Tests}

Rank transformations may be useful for particular sensitivity analyses, but depend on the type of data and sample selection. In grid-based techniques, the model outputs may have a sort of distribution or cluster of interest. With a rank transformation, visualizing this will be difficult, since the data is transformed to a uniform distribution.

\vspace{1em}
Similarly, statistical tests may be employed when proper assumptions hold true. In this model, the outputs may not be normally distributed (as in the Fib + MRE/LB Accuracy full-factorial experiment).

Here is a verification that my sampling correlation was induced properly:

\includegraphics[width = .32\textwidth]{corr_ex2}
\includegraphics[width = .32\textwidth]{corr_ex3}\\

\begin{columns}
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\footnotesize{I chose these sampling correlations since there should in theory be a fairly strong correlation between sensitivity and specificity for a good clinical test. However, in some cases, they may not have as much correlation or be weakly correlated. I also assumed a normal distribution of sampling, since these test results are likely also normally distributed.} 
\end{column}
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{block}{Correction!}
In reality there is more often a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity (not all clinical tests are perfect). Would have been more realistic to have shifted sampling to more properly represent ROC curve!

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Question 3i $|$ Importance Sampling}

I changed my sampling distribution from uniform (as in random, lhs, orthogonal sampling). I used a Beta($\alpha,\beta$) distribution with $\alpha = 5$ and $\beta = 2$ for both MRE specificity and senstivity to simulate a more optimistic sampling distribution. This beta distribution implies that the model output means are representative of samples with left-skewed sensitivity and specificity.

\begin{column}{0.45\textwidth}

\includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{beta_dist} 
\end{column}
\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Question 3i $|$ Importance Sampling}
The output averages were as follows:
\vspace{1em}
\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
 & \multicolumn{ 2}{l|}{\textbf{\hspace{1em} Parameter Varied}} \\ \hline
 & \textbf{MRE Sens} & \textbf{MRE Spec} \\ \hline
\textbf{Cost} & \multicolumn{1}{r|}{767.0697} & \multicolumn{1}{r|}{706.8664} \\ \hline
\textbf{Accuracy} & \multicolumn{1}{r|}{0.9324} & \multicolumn{1}{r|}{0.9471} \\ \hline
\end{tabular}\end{table}
\vspace{1em}
As sensitivity is skewed left, the accuracy decreases and cost increases. Conversely, as specificity is skewed left, the accuracy increases, and the cost decreases. This could be because a higher positive test rate (true in screening tests with higher sensitivity) results in a required confirmatory test with another method with additional costs. A more specific test means less false positives, which prevents decreases the likelihood of this added cost.
